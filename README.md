### Database initialization
First, ensure that psql is installed (if installed but unavailable, make sure it is added to your shell profile):

#### Set user and password and create database
First create the database:

    createdb -U postgres -h 127.0.0.1 olympics

Open a psql prompt for the user postgres with host 127.0.0.1:

    psql -U postgres -h 127.0.0.1

Once inside the shell run the following command to set the password for the user postgres:

    ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD '123';

Then quit the shell

    \q

#### Populate the tables
Navigate to the olympics_app folder and run the schema.sql file in your database:

    psql -U postgres -h 127.0.0.1 -d olympics -f schema.sql

Then run the python file load_data.py (it can take a minute...):

    python3 load_data.py

### Run the app
To start the web app run the python file run.py:

    python3 run.py

Then open a web browser and navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:5000>

The web app should now be up and running. The landing page gives
